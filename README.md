## About

---

My passion is in creating new technologies and new capabilities within organizations. I do this by building teams, technology and visions. My success has been driven by developing a deep understanding of a problem or opportunity and being able to simplify the problem into easily understood sets of questions. These questions serve as the guiding principles for the technology development and team cohesion. Through these fundamental questions I have been able to create and lead multiple teams that have been able to create amazing technology developments. In addition to these teams being very productive and high performing, the most important thing is that they are sustainable. The teams and labs that I have formed have continued with the principles, innovation and collaboration after I have moved on to my next assignment.
